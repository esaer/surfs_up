2. The min temperature is 64 in June and 56 in Dec
3. The max temperature is 85 in June and 83 in Dec

## Surfs_up Summary 
The high level summary is that the temperature between June and Dec is not that different given there's only 4 degrees's differenece. The main difference is at night when temperatures drop. The day time temperature is very close though. Therefore the ice cream business will likely be sustainable. The next step is probably to query the number of rainy days in a year and or the number of days when there's hurricane. Both situations will impact the retail business.
